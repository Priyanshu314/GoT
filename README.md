# GoT
Guardian of Things (GoT) : GPT enhanced cybersecurity for IoT devices trained on a tailored dataset of attack/defence commands with information on required Kali Linux tools and steps.

GoT works in a two layer prompt mode :
1. The input prompt to defend/attack the device lists the steps and hacking tools needed.

2. The steps and required tools are fed again to generate clean python scripts to defend/attack the device.
